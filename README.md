Religious Path:

Construct your church, using as many buildings as you like for librarys or priests' cabin, however your main cathedral must be built almost completely from Biomass and Nether Quartz, the flesh and bones of true malice, for blood must cover your cathedral floors, construct Kokapelli where you feel most Appropriate, construct Hephutus and Minaesva in your library with lots of chests for repairs,enchants,and knowledge obtainment, include an enchantment table for making spellbooks, lastly place jupiwulf outside to protect you from dangerous elements. Summon an Abyss Portal, this is our true master, the land of the dead, and now we work on rising it, but how? KILL!!! Lots of death means lots of possible blood which means lot of germinating biomass, also frequent the nether, go on quartz collecting sprees, these blocks are your new stones and planks, build everything outta them, villagers houses, stores, shrines, etc. Next, craft yourself a Necronomicon and start practicing the art of keeping as many souls as you can reap tied to this world thro Resurrection, just dont forget the blood, Finally Place Anubis in the Abyss as the rightful protector of the dead, and frequent your path until our time comes, the abyss will rise and devour all living!!

- Abyss Prayer: 
Now i lay thee down to sleep, beg the abyss my sanity keep, If i shall die before i wake, beg the abyss my mind shall take!!

- Flesh Sacrificing
Build a shrine around jupiwulf making sure to leave the ceiling directly above his head open to invite the lightning in, place iron blocks on all sides of the empty spot above his head to act as sort of a hopper, replace the front one with a stone slab for easy access in case of low ceiling, now start killing zombies, bring the flesh back and throw it into his hopper, when his crown is struck your sacrifice will be taken.

Abyssals are skilled acrobats, the boots of the traveller will assist you in this manner. Further more placing latters on top legdes of houses and churchs will help with jumping to and scaling ledges. Practice makes perfect!
